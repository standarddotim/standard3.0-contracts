/**
 * @title Oracle
 * @notice Fixed-cardinality, time-weighted average price (TWAP) ring buffer for a single
 * Orderbook's last-matched price (`lmp`). `Orderbook.setLmp` is the single choke point every
 * price update funnels through -- every market order, every crossing limit order, and the
 * initial listing price all call it (see `MatchingEngine.sol`'s six call sites) -- so hooking
 * the accumulator there covers every way `lmp` can move, without needing any change to
 * `MatchingEngine.sol` or the matching logic itself.
 *
 * Threat model this defends against: `lmp()` is a single stored value that can be moved by a
 * single trade in the same block as a subsequent transaction that reads it (see
 * docs/swap/design.md's MEV section for the full walkthrough). Bounding a trade's price
 * relative to `lmp()` -- e.g. `lmp() * (1 +/- slippageLimit)` -- does not protect against this,
 * because the reference point itself is what gets manipulated; the bound just follows it.
 * `twap()` instead averages price over many blocks, so a single manipulated block can only ever
 * contribute a small fraction of the result.
 *
 * Design choices, and why:
 * - One observation written per block, max (`write` no-ops if already written this block).
 *   This is the load-bearing security property: without it, an attacker could spam many
 *   same-block/same-window transactions to evict old observations out of the fixed-size ring
 *   buffer faster than real time passes, artificially shrinking the *effective* window
 *   regardless of what `minSecondsAgo` the caller requested. With the throttle, evicting a
 *   given observation requires actually waiting out `ORACLE_CARDINALITY` blocks, not just
 *   paying for that many transactions.
 * - `twap(minSecondsAgo)` returns the average over an *actual* window that is >= `minSecondsAgo`
 *   (never less, may be slightly more), computed between two *real* stored observations. This
 *   deliberately avoids interpolating a synthetic price at an exact sub-observation timestamp:
 *   interpolation is where subtle TWAP oracle bugs live, and "the window is a little longer
 *   than requested" is strictly more manipulation-resistant than "a little shorter", so the
 *   simplification is conservative rather than a compromise.
 * - Fixed-size array (not a dynamically-`push`ed one) so the buffer costs nothing to create at
 *   pair-listing time -- storage slots are implicitly zero/uninitialized until actually written,
 *   at normal per-write SSTORE cost only.
